### `saas-development`

**Purpose:** API specification and SaaS architecture planning  
**Status:** üü° In Progress - API design phase  
**Description:** Comprehensive API documentation and planning for potential SaaS expansion of the Taschengeld platform.

**Current Progress:**

- ‚úÖ API specification document created

### `feature/svg-management-tool`

**Purpose:** Build development-only SVG icon management interface  
**Status:** üü† On Hold - Awaiting icon system completion  
**Description:** Creates a visual web interface for managing SVG icons without requiring code changes. Development environment only - never deployed to production.

**Dependencies:** Requires completion of `feature/icon-system-refactor`

**Next Steps:** Resume after icon system refactor is merged

---

### `feature/icon-system-refactor`

**Purpose:** Centralized icon system with enhanced search and filtering  
**Status:** üü† Paused - Awaiting design decisions  
**Description:** Replaces scattered icon handling with centralized registry supporting 154+ icons, search, filtering, and categorization.

**Current Status:** Core functionality complete, integration decisions pending

**Next Steps:** Resume after current feature priorities are complete

### `feature/enhanced-access-control`

**Purpose:** Multi-device access policies and improved session management  
**Status:** üü† Planned - Design phase  
**Description:** Enhances the family-friendly access control system with device-specific policies and better session persistence.

**Planned Features:**

## üîÑ **Branch Lifecycle Management**

### **Creating New Branches**

1. **Always start from `development`**:

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Document immediately**:

   - Add entry to this BRANCHES.md file
   - Set branch description: `git config branch.$(git branch --show-current).description "Purpose: Brief description"`
   - Create initial commit with documentation

3. **Use descriptive naming**:
   - `feature/` - New functionality
   - `hotfix/` - Critical production fixes
   - `refactor/` - Code improvements without new features
   - `docs/` - Documentation-only changes

### **Maintaining Branches**

- **Update status regularly** in this file
- **Keep branch descriptions current**
- **Merge from development periodically** to stay current
- **Document major milestones** and blockers

### **Completing Branches**

1. **Final testing** on the branch
2. **Update documentation** (mark as complete)
3. **Create Pull Request** with reference to this documentation
4. **After merge**: Delete branch and remove from active list

## üéØ **Branch Strategy Summary**

- **`main`**: Production releases only
- **`development`**: Integration branch for ongoing work
- **`feature/*`**: Individual features and enhancements
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical production fixes

## üì± **Current Development Focus**

**Primary:** SaaS Development (API specification phase)  
**Secondary:** Enhanced Access Control (design phase)  
**Completed:** Savings Goals Feature (100% complete)
**On Hold:** Icon System Integration, SVG Management Tool

**Immediate Priorities:**

1. Complete SaaS development API specification
