**Technical Details:**
- Location: `/app/dev-tools/svg-manager/`
- API endpoints: `/api/dev-tools/icons/`
- Access: Only available when `NODE_ENV=development`
- Dependencies: Built on existing icon system foundation

**Testing:**
- Upload various SVG files and verify processing
- Confirm security scanning catches malicious content
- Test integration with icon selector components

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete icon categorization interface
2. Implement registry update functionality  
3. Add bulk operations (move, delete, archive)
4. Final testing and documentation

### `feature/icon-system-refactor`
**Purpose:** Centralized icon system with enhanced search and filtering  
**Status:** üü° In Progress - Core system complete, integration ongoing  
**Description:** Replaces scattered icon handling with centralized registry supporting 154+ icons, search, filtering, and categorization.

**Key Features:**
- Centralized icon registry with metadata
- Enhanced IconSelector with search functionality
- Category-based filtering (people, objects, activities, etc.)
- Backward compatibility with existing components
- Type-safe icon definitions and usage

**Current Progress:**
- ‚úÖ Icon registry with 154 icons completed
- ‚úÖ Enhanced IconDisplay and IconSelector components
- ‚úÖ Search and filtering functionality
- üü° Component integration in progress
- ‚è≥ Documentation updates pending

**Components Updated:**
- User management modals (add/edit)
- Task management modals (add/edit)  
- Icon selector throughout application
- Withdraw funds modal

**Testing:**
- Verify all existing icons display correctly
- Test search functionality with various keywords
- Confirm category filtering works properly
- Check backward compatibility

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete remaining component integrations
2. Update documentation with new icon system
3. Add icon usage analytics (optional)
4. Performance testing with large icon sets

### `feature/enhanced-access-control`
**Purpose:** Multi-device access policies and improved session management  
**Status:** üü† Planned - Design phase  
**Description:** Enhances the family-friendly access control system with device-specific policies and better session persistence.

**Planned Features:**
- Device-specific access policies
- Session persistence across browser restarts
- Admin failsafe for PIN recovery
- Multi-device policy management
- Improved parent/child mode switching

**Design Goals:**
- Maintain family-friendly, kiosk-style operation
- Support different policies per device (iPad vs family computer)
- Keep simple for non-technical family members
- Provide admin override capabilities

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Phase 1:** Session persistence and admin failsafe
2. **Phase 2:** Device detection and registration  
3. **Phase 3:** Policy engine and management UI
4. **Phase 4:** Testing and documentation

**Dependencies:**
- Requires completion of icon system work
- Should integrate with existing PIN system
- Must maintain backward compatibility

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete detailed technical design
2. Create implementation timeline
3. Begin with session persistence improvements
4. Add admin failsafe mechanisms

### `develop` ‚ö†Ô∏è **SCHEDULED FOR DELETION**
**Purpose:** Learning branch for Git workflow tutorials  
**Status:** üî¥ Ready for deletion  
**Description:** This branch was created for learning Git operations and contains the branch indicator feature work. The actual work has been properly committed and the branch is no longer needed.

**Contents:**
- Branch indicator feature (already committed to proper branch)
- Git workflow learning exercises
- Docker configuration updates

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Delete this branch when ready:
git branch -D develop
```

**Note:** All valuable work from this branch has been preserved in the proper feature branches.

## üîÑ **Branch Lifecycle Management**

### **Creating New Branches**
1. **Always start from `development`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Document immediately**:
   - Add entry to this BRANCHES.md file
   - Set branch description: `git config branch.$(git branch --show-current).description "Purpose: Brief description"`
   - Create initial commit with documentation

3. **Use descriptive naming**:
   - `feature/` - New functionality
   - `hotfix/` - Critical production fixes  
   - `refactor/` - Code improvements without new features
   - `docs/` - Documentation-only changes

### **Maintaining Branches**
- **Update status regularly** in this file
- **Keep branch descriptions current**
- **Merge from development periodically** to stay current
- **Document major milestones** and blockers

### **Completing Branches**
1. **Final testing** on the branch
2. **Update documentation** (mark as complete)
3. **Create Pull Request** with reference to this documentation
4. **After merge**: Delete branch and remove from active list

## üéØ **Branch Strategy Summary**

- **`main`**: Production releases only
- **`development`**: Integration branch for ongoing work
- **`feature/*`**: Individual features and enhancements  
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical production fixes

## üì± **Current Development Focus**

**Primary:** SVG Management Tool (80% complete)  
**Secondary:** Icon System Integration (90% complete)  
**Planned:** Enhanced Access Control (design phase)

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. Complete SVG tool icon organization UI
2. Finish icon system component integrations
