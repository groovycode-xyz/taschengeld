- Default behavior: Parent mode if not set

**Testing:**
1. Set child mode ‚Üí refresh browser ‚Üí verify stays in child mode
2. Set parent mode ‚Üí refresh browser ‚Üí verify stays in parent mode
3. Open multiple tabs ‚Üí change mode in one ‚Üí verify sync
4. Clear localStorage ‚Üí verify defaults to parent mode

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete manual testing on all target devices
2. Verify no conflicts with existing PIN system
3. Test on actual iPad devices
4. Merge to development branch
