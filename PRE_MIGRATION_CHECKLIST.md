## ✅ Final Checks

### Functionality Test
- [x] User creation works
- [x] Task creation works
- [x] Task completion works
- [x] Payday process works
- [x] Piggy bank transactions work
- [x] Backup/restore works
- [x] Settings changes persist

### Technical Verification
```bash
# Run these commands and verify output

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
# Expected: cleanup-phase-1-retry

# Check git status
git status
# Expected: nothing to commit, working tree clean

# Check Docker status
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps
# Expected: all services healthy

# Check application health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}
```
