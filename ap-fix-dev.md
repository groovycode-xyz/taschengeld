# Action Plan: Transitioning to Docker-First Development and Deployment

## Objective

To transition the Taschengeld application from its current hybrid Next.js/Docker approach to a proper Docker-first architecture, ensuring consistent behavior between development and production environments.

## Current State Analysis

### Development Environment Issues

- Inconsistent use of Docker for development
- Mixed local and containerized development practices
- Incomplete multi-architecture support
- Inconsistent environment variable management

### Production Environment Issues

- Features working in development fail in production
- Incomplete production build optimization
- Inconsistent dependency management
- Suboptimal Docker image layering

### Infrastructure Gaps

- Lack of proper multi-architecture build pipeline
- Inconsistent database migration handling
- Incomplete environment parity
- Missing validation steps between environments

## Ideal Docker-First Architecture

### Development Principles

1. All development occurs in Docker containers
2. Environment parity between development and production
3. Consistent multi-architecture support
4. Automated testing and validation
5. Clear separation of development and production concerns

### Production Requirements

1. Optimized Docker images
2. Proper dependency management
3. Secure environment variable handling
4. Reliable database migration process
5. Comprehensive backup and restore procedures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Setup (Week 1)

- [ ] Document current application state

  - [ ] Map all environment variables
  - [ ] List all dependencies
  - [ ] Document build processes
  - [ ] Identify critical features

- [ ] Create parallel development track
  - [ ] Set up new Docker-based development environment
  - [ ] Configure development database
  - [ ] Test basic functionality

**Validation Point 1:**

- [ ] Verify all features work in new development environment
- [ ] Compare performance metrics
- [ ] Document any discrepancies

### Phase 2: Docker Configuration Optimization (Week 2)

- [ ] Update Dockerfile.dev

  - [ ] Optimize layer caching
  - [ ] Implement proper multi-stage builds
  - [ ] Configure development-specific settings

- [ ] Update Dockerfile.prod

  - [ ] Remove development dependencies
  - [ ] Optimize for production
  - [ ] Implement security best practices

- [ ] Update docker-compose configurations
  - [ ] Separate development and production configs
  - [ ] Implement proper volume management
  - [ ] Configure networking

**Validation Point 2:**

- [ ] Build both development and production images
- [ ] Test all features in both environments
- [ ] Verify build times and image sizes

### Phase 3: Database and State Management (Week 3)

- [ ] Implement proper migration strategy

  - [ ] Create migration validation process
  - [ ] Set up rollback procedures
  - [ ] Document database state management

- [ ] Configure data persistence
  - [ ] Set up volume management
  - [ ] Implement backup procedures
  - [ ] Test restore functionality

**Validation Point 3:**

- [ ] Run full migration test
- [ ] Verify data persistence
- [ ] Test backup and restore

### Phase 4: Multi-Architecture Support (Week 4)

- [ ] Configure buildx environment

  - [ ] Set up multi-architecture builders
  - [ ] Configure platform-specific optimizations

- [ ] Update build scripts
  - [ ] Implement cross-platform testing
  - [ ] Create unified build pipeline
  - [ ] Set up automated testing

**Validation Point 4:**

- [ ] Build for all target architectures
- [ ] Test on different platforms
- [ ] Verify performance consistency

### Phase 5: Production Deployment (Week 5)

- [ ] Create deployment pipeline

  - [ ] Set up automated builds
  - [ ] Configure testing stages
  - [ ] Implement deployment validation

- [ ] Update documentation
  - [ ] Document deployment procedures
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guides
  - [ ] Update development guides

**Validation Point 5:**

- [ ] Full production deployment test
- [ ] Verify all features in production
- [ ] Test rollback procedures

## Success Criteria

1. All features work consistently in both environments
2. Build process is fully automated
3. Multi-architecture support is complete
4. Database migrations are reliable
5. Documentation is comprehensive
6. Rollback procedures are tested

## Rollback Plan

1. Maintain parallel environments during transition
2. Document state at each validation point
3. Create restore points for database
4. Test rollback procedures before each phase
5. Maintain backup of original configuration

## Timeline

- Total Duration: 5 weeks
- Each phase: 1 week
- Additional buffer: 1 week for unexpected issues

## Risk Mitigation

1. Regular testing throughout implementation
2. Parallel environments during transition
3. Comprehensive documentation of changes
4. Regular backups at each phase
5. Clear success criteria for each step
