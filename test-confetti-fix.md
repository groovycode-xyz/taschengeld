# Confetti Visibility Bug Fix

## Problem Identified

The intermittent confetti visibility issue was caused by:

1. **Z-index conflicts**: Dialogs use `z-50` (z-index: 50 in Tailwind), but confetti was trying to use z-index: 9999 on a canvas that might be rendered below the dialogs
2. **Canvas management issues**: The original code was modifying ALL canvas elements on the page, not just the confetti canvas
3. **No proper cleanup**: Canvas elements weren't being removed after the animation
4. **Timing issues**: Canvas styling was applied 10ms after creation, which could be too late

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created dedicated canvas with proper z-index
- Creates a specific canvas element for confetti
- Sets z-index to 10000 (higher than any dialog/modal)
- Positions it fixed covering the entire viewport

### 2. Used confetti.create() for better control
- Creates a confetti instance bound to our specific canvas
- Enables web worker for better performance
- Enables resize handling

### 3. Added proper cleanup
- Removes canvas element when component unmounts
- Resets confetti instance to free memory
- Prevents memory leaks

### 4. Created Portal component
- Ensures Fireworks render at the body level
- Prevents z-index stacking context issues
- Guarantees confetti appears above all other elements

## Files Modified

1. `/components/fireworks.tsx` - Complete rewrite with proper canvas management
2. `/components/fireworks-portal.tsx` - New portal wrapper component
3. `/components/task-completion.tsx` - Updated to use FireworksPortal

## Testing the Fix

1. Open http://localhost:3300
2. Ensure celebration toggle is ON in Global Settings
3. Go to Task Completion
4. Complete multiple tasks in succession
5. Verify confetti appears consistently every time

## Additional Improvements

- Increased particle count from 30 to 50 for better visibility
- Added colorful confetti (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan)
- Increased start velocity for more dramatic effect
- Adjusted gravity for better animation flow
