# Taschengeld Family Allowance Application

Taschengeld is an allowance tracker application designed to help families manage chores, tasks, and allowances for children. It features a user-friendly interface for both parents and children to interact with.

Taschengeld is the German word for "pocket money" and was developed for a family in Switzerland. As a result, there are two German words, "Taschengeld" and "SparkÃ¤sseli" which means "Piggy-Bank".

A modern task management system built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker.

The rest of this document is for users of the application (AKA: "Production").

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

The application is available as a multi-architecture Docker image that supports both ARM64 (Apple Silicon) and AMD64 (Intel/AMD) platforms. Docker will automatically select the correct version for your system.

1. Pull the image:
```bash
docker pull tgeld/tgeld:latest
```

2. Run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

Note: The multi-arch image ensures compatibility across different platforms without any additional configuration.

## Quick Start

1. Create directory structure
2. Create docker-compose.yml and .env and set variables (port and password)
3. Execute: docker compose up -d

### Detailed Setup Steps

1. Create a new directory for your Tgeld installation and database storage:

   ```bash
   mkdir tgeld && cd tgeld
   mkdir -p ./data/postgres
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your configuration. Copy and modify the following template:

   ```bash
   # Database
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password  # CHANGE THIS to a secure password
   POSTGRES_DB=tgeld
   
   # IMPORTANT: Use direct values here, DO NOT use ${VAR} references
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_secure_password@db:5432/tgeld?schema=public
   
   # Data directory for PostgreSQL (adjust path as needed)
   POSTGRES_DATA_DIR=./data/postgres
   ```

   **Important Notes:**
   - Replace `your_secure_password` with your chosen password in BOTH places
   - The DATABASE_URL must use direct values, not ${VAR} references
   - Example of correct DATABASE_URL:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:MyPassword123@db:5432/tgeld?schema=public
     ```
   - Make sure the POSTGRES_DATA_DIR path exists before starting

3. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content. Change only the ports if needed:

   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       image: tgeld/tgeld:latest
       ports:
         - '8071:3000' #change left number if port 8071 is already in use on your system (e.g., "8072:3000")
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
       depends_on:
         - db
     db:
       image: postgres:16-alpine
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
         - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
       volumes:
         - ${POSTGRES_DATA_DIR}:/var/lib/postgresql/data
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8071` (or whichever port you configured in `docker-compose.yml`).

> **Note about ports**: In the `docker-compose.yml` file, the ports are configured as `HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT`. If port 8071 is already in use on your system, change the left number to an available port (e.g., "8072:3000"). The right number must remain 3000 as that's the port the application uses inside the container.

> **Note about data storage**: PostgreSQL data is stored in the directory specified by `POSTGRES_DATA_DIR` in your `.env` file. By default, this is `./data/postgres` relative to your docker-compose.yml file. You can change this to any location on your system (e.g., `/home/user/backups/tgeld/postgres` or `C:\tgeld\data\postgres`) to better integrate with your backup system. Just make sure the directory exists before starting the containers.

## Database Management

### Create a database backup:

#### From outside the application:

```bash
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres tgeld > backup.sql
```

or

#### From within the application:

- Click the Global App Settings icon found on the top right corner.
- Scroll to the Backup and Restore Section.
- Locate Full Database Backup and click the "Download" button. Save file to your preferred location.

### Restore a database backup:

#### From outside the application:

```bash
cat backup.sql | docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d tgeld
```

or

#### From within the application:

- Click the Global App Settings icon found on the top right corner.
- Scroll to the Backup and Restore Section.
- Locate Full Database Backup and click the "Upload" button. Find the saved file to your preferred location.

## Updating the Application

To update to the latest version (Docker image):

```bash
docker compose down    # Stop and remove existing containers
docker compose pull   # Get the latest version of the image
docker compose up -d  # Start containers with the new version
```

> **Note about disk space**: The update process keeps old versions of the images on your system. If you want to clean up old, unused images to free up disk space, you can run:

```bash
docker image prune -f  # Remove unused images
```

Or to see how much space can be freed first:

```bash
docker image prune -f --dry-run  # Show what would be removed
```
