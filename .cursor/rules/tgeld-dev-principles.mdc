This project has strictly defined rules for software development.
Read the files:
/docs/docker-development-principles.md
/docs/docker-development-principles.jpg
/docs/docker-development-principles.drawio
/README_DEV.md

Good to know is also the /README.md  #Used for understaning how the Production environment is to be set up and utilized.

Your development environment is:
MacBook Pro M1 Max
- contains this project codebase
- Used only for development
- Docker Compose is installed
- You have terminal console access
- ONLY USE /README_DEV.md when interacting with this system

Ubuntu Server (happy)
- is the production environment
- never runs the development environment
- Docker Compose is installed
- You can ssh to this server using terminal console and "ssh happy" to establish connection
- ONLY USE /README.md when interacting with this server
