Please systematically review and document the implementation details of the following interfaces in our application:

[LIST OF INTERFACES TO DOCUMENT]

For each interface, please:

1. Search for and analyze the actual implementation files
2. Document the following aspects in detail:
   - Components and their structure
   - Data flow and API endpoints
   - State management
   - Process flows
   - Error handling
   - Visual feedback
   - Security considerations

3. Update the documentation in `docs/user-experience-flow.md` with accurate implementation details

Please follow these guidelines:
- Use semantic search to find relevant implementation files
- Read and analyze the actual code implementation
- Document based on real code, not assumptions
- Maintain consistent structure across all interfaces
- Include code snippets where relevant
- Focus on technical accuracy and completeness
- Do not suggest improvements or new features
- Keep testing simple without frameworks
- Use zsh for any terminal commands

The documentation should be detailed enough to serve as a comprehensive reference for developers working with these interfaces.

Please proceed interface by interface, confirming each section before moving to the next.
