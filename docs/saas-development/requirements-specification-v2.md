# Requirements Specification v2 - Taschengeld SaaS

**Document Version**: 2.1  
**Date**: 2025-07-09  
**Status**: Living Document  
**Latest Review**: 2025-07-09  
**Project**: Taschengeld SaaS Transformation  
**Philosophy**: Household Management Tool (Not a Children's App)

## Executive Summary

Taschengeld is a **household management tool** that allows subscribers to track tasks, responsibilities, and rewards within their household. Like Excel or a whiteboard, it provides structure for families to implement their own systems. We make no assumptions about who uses the tool or what the numbers represent.

## Core Principles

1. **Tool, Not Service**: We provide a structured template; subscribers decide how to use it
2. **Identity-Agnostic**: In-app profiles are labels, not verified identities
3. **Content, Not Data Subjects**: Profile data is user-generated content owned by the subscriber
4. **Honor System**: No verification of who clicks buttons or completes actions
5. **Value-Neutral**: Numbers could represent dollars, hearts, points, or peanuts
