# Working Session Tracker - Taschengeld SaaS Development

**Document Purpose**: Context window safety net and session continuity tracker  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-09  
**Current Status**: Technical Architecture Phase

## üéØ Quick Context Reset Guide

**For New Agent Context**: If you're a fresh agent taking over this project, read this section first:

### Project Overview
We are transforming the existing self-hosted Taschengeld (family allowance tracker) Docker application into a subscription-based SaaS platform. This is a strategic business pivot to address user demand from families who want the product but lack Docker expertise.

### Current Self-Hosted Product
- **Technology**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Users**: Families managing children's tasks and allowances
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, single-tenant, desktop/tablet focused (768px+)
- **Authentication**: Simple PIN-based parent/child mode switching

### SaaS Transformation Goals
- **Multi-tenant**: Support thousands of families on shared infrastructure
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design down to 320px (phones)
- **Authentication**: Email accounts with OAuth, family management, RBAC
- **Business Model**: Freemium subscription ($0 ‚Üí $4.99 ‚Üí $9.99/month)
- **Global**: Worldwide deployment with GDPR/COPPA compliance

### What We've Completed
1. ‚úÖ **Strategic Planning**: Business model, pricing, revenue projections
2. ‚úÖ **Requirements Specification**: Comprehensive breakdown of 50+ requirements
3. ‚úÖ **Architecture Foundation**: Multi-tenancy, authentication, mobile design, compliance
4. ‚úÖ **Documentation Framework**: Structured methodology and document registry

### What We're Working On
- Technical architecture document (detailed system design)
- API specification (RESTful endpoint design)
- UX flows and wireframes (user experience design)

### Key Constraints
- **No AI/ML**: Explicitly excluded from requirements
- **Compliance-First**: GDPR, COPPA, Swiss data laws must be built-in
- **Family-Focused**: Parent-child relationships add complexity
- **Bootstrap Funding**: Single developer + designer team initially

## üìä Session Progress Tracking

### Current Session Status
**Session Date**: 2025-07-08 - 2025-07-09  
**Focus Area**: Requirements Review & Major Paradigm Shift  
**Participants**: User (Product Owner) + Claude (Technical Architect)

## üîÑ MAJOR PARADIGM SHIFT

**Critical Insight**: Taschengeld is a **household management tool** (like Excel), NOT a children's app

**Key Principles Established**:
1. **Tool, Not Service**: We provide structure; households decide usage
2. **Identity-Agnostic**: Profiles are labels (Dragon, Bunny), not real identities  
3. **Honor System**: No verification of who clicks buttons
4. **Subscriber-Only Identity**: Only the paying adult needs real identity
5. **User Content Model**: Profiles are content owned by subscriber

**Impact**: This dramatically simplifies our architecture, compliance, and implementation

### What We've Accomplished This Session
1. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive PRD for SaaS version
2. ‚úÖ Built detailed requirements specification (9 categories, 50+ requirements)
3. ‚úÖ Established regulatory compliance architecture
4. ‚úÖ Created documentation methodology and framework
5. ‚úÖ Built document registry with status tracking
6. ‚úÖ Completed 6 core architectural documents
7. ‚úÖ **PARADIGM SHIFT**: Reframed entire approach as household tool
8. ‚úÖ Created simplified requirements v2 based on new philosophy
9. ‚úÖ Designed simplified data model removing complex identity management
10. ‚úÖ Updated compliance strategy to tool vs service approach
11. ‚úÖ Added birth order to replace birthdate (no PII)
12. ‚úÖ Created diverse use case examples (medieval, gaming, etc.)
13. ‚úÖ Developed language neutralization guide for UI
14. ‚úÖ **Created Technical Architecture Document** - Complete system design with AWS infrastructure
15. ‚úÖ **Requirements Review Session** - Updated requirements v2.1 with tiering, terminology customization
16. ‚úÖ **Created Subscription Tiers Document** - Detailed Free/Basic/Premium feature breakdown

### Current Discussion Topics
- **Context Window Management**: Building safety nets for agent handoffs
- **Next Steps Planning**: Prioritizing technical architecture and API design
- **Methodology**: Ensuring systematic approach without "token burning"
- **MAJOR PARADIGM SHIFT**: Reframed as household tool, not children's app

### Ready to Begin Next Phase
- ‚úÖ **Safety Net Complete**: Working session tracker and context management
- ‚úÖ **Foundation Complete**: All strategic and requirements documents finished
- ‚úÖ **Requirements Rewritten**: New philosophy implemented
- ‚úÖ **APPROVED**: Stakeholder has approved simplified approach (2025-07-09)
- ‚úÖ **Technical Architecture Complete**: AWS infrastructure design aligned with household tool model
- üéØ **Next Action**: Create api-specification.md document

### Decisions Made This Session
1. **Documentation Approach**: 5-phase methodology (Strategy ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Operations)
2. **Requirements Format**: Structured with priorities, acceptance criteria, dependencies, traceability
3. **No AI Components**: Explicitly excluded from architecture and requirements
4. **Compliance Priority**: GDPR/COPPA requirements drive architectural decisions
5. **Mobile-First**: Complete UI transformation required for mobile devices
6. **MAJOR SHIFT**: Taschengeld is a household tool (like Excel), not a children's app
7. **Identity Philosophy**: Only subscriber needs real identity; profiles are just labels
8. **Compliance Simplification**: Only protect subscriber data; profiles are user content
9. **Data Model Simplification**: Remove complex family relationships and age tracking
10. **Honor System**: No verification of who clicks buttons within household
11. **Birth Order Not Age**: Optional ordering (1st, 2nd, 3rd) instead of birthdates
12. **Diverse Marketing**: Medieval, gaming, and other use cases beyond families
13. **Language Neutralization**: Manager/Member instead of Parent/Child throughout UI

### For New Session After Context Reset
**Essential Context to Provide**:
1. Link to this tracker document
2. Current phase: "Moving from requirements to technical architecture"
3. Key constraint: "Family-focused SaaS with GDPR/COPPA compliance, no AI components"
4. Current priority: "Technical architecture document creation"

### Session Handoff Template
```
Hi! I'm continuing work on the Taschengeld SaaS transformation project. 

Please read: /docs/saas-development/working-session-tracker.md

CRITICAL PARADIGM SHIFT: Taschengeld is a household management TOOL (like Excel), 
NOT a children's app. Only subscribers need real identity; profiles are just labels.

Current status: Major requirements simplification complete. Ready for technical architecture 
based on simplified model.

Key context:
- Household management tool, not children's service
- Subscriber (adult) pays; creates profiles (Dragon, Bunny, etc.)
- No age verification, no identity verification for profiles
- Simplified compliance: Only protect subscriber data
- Simplified data model: No complex family relationships

What I need: Review new simplified approach and proceed with technical architecture
```
