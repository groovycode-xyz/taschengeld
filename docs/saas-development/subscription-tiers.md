## Technical Implementation

### Enforcement Points
```typescript
interface SubscriptionLimits {
  maxMembers: number | 'unlimited';
  maxTasks: number | 'unlimited';
  maxIcons: number;
  features: {
    photoAttachments: boolean;
    customSymbols: boolean;
    customTerminology: boolean;
    reporting: boolean;
    backupDays: number;
  };
}

const TIER_LIMITS: Record<SubscriptionTier, SubscriptionLimits> = {
  free: {
    maxMembers: 1,
    maxTasks: 3,
    maxIcons: 5,
    features: {
      photoAttachments: false,
      customSymbols: false,
      customTerminology: false,
      reporting: false,
      backupDays: 0
    }
  },
  basic: {
    maxMembers: 5,
    maxTasks: 'unlimited',
    maxIcons: 20,
    features: {
      photoAttachments: false,
      customSymbols: false,
      customTerminology: false,
      reporting: false,
      backupDays: 5
    }
  },
  premium: {
    maxMembers: 'unlimited',
    maxTasks: 'unlimited',
    maxIcons: 'unlimited',
    features: {
      photoAttachments: true,
      customSymbols: true,
      customTerminology: true,
      reporting: true,
      backupDays: 30
    }
  }
};
```

### Grace Periods
- Downgrade: 30-day grace period to reduce members/tasks
- Payment failure: 7-day grace period before account suspension
- Cancellation: Data retained for 90 days

## Revenue Projections

Based on typical SaaS conversion rates:
- 60% stay on free tier
- 30% convert to basic ($4.99)
- 10% convert to premium ($9.99)

**Per 1000 users**:
- 600 free √ó $0 = $0
- 300 basic √ó $4.99 = $1,497
- 100 premium √ó $9.99 = $999
- **Total MRR**: $2,496

## Key Decisions

1. **No per-member pricing**: Simpler than $2/member model
2. **Generous free tier**: 1 member + 3 tasks is enough to test
3. **Clear upgrade paths**: Hit limits naturally through usage
4. **Premium terminology**: Major differentiator for power users
5. **Backup as invisible feature**: Users expect it, not a selling point

**Next Steps**:
1. Update requirements specification with tier information
2. Design upgrade/downgrade flows
3. Create pricing page mockups
4. Define grace period behaviors
