# Compliance Strategy v2 - Taschengeld as a Household Tool

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: 2025-07-09  
**Fundamental Principle**: We are a household management tool, not a children's service

## Executive Summary

Taschengeld's compliance strategy is based on a fundamental distinction: we provide a **tool** for household management (like Excel or a notebook), not a **service** directed at children. This dramatically simplifies our compliance obligations while maintaining full legal compliance.

## Core Compliance Position

### What We Are

1. **Household Management Tool**
   - Like Excel, Notion, or a physical whiteboard
   - General-purpose tool for tracking household activities
   - Subscriber decides how to use it

2. **B2C SaaS for Adults**
   - We contract with adult subscribers
   - Subscribers pay for access to our tool
   - Similar to productivity software subscriptions

3. **Content Platform**
   - Subscribers create profiles (like game characters)
   - Profiles are user-generated content
   - We don't verify or validate this content

### What We Are NOT

1. **NOT a Children's Service**
   - Not directed at children under 13
   - Not marketed to children
   - Not designed specifically for children

2. **NOT Collecting Children's Data**
   - Profiles are creative labels, not real identities
   - No age verification or collection
   - No direct relationship with children

3. **NOT a Data Controller for Minors**
   - Subscriber is the data controller for their household
   - We only process subscriber (adult) data
   - Household profiles are subscriber's content

## GDPR Compliance Simplified

### Our Data Subjects

**Only One Type: Adult Subscribers**
- The person who creates the account
- The person who pays for the service
- The person who agrees to our terms

### GDPR Rights Apply To

✅ **Subscriber Account Data**:
- Email address
- Payment information  
- Login history
- Account settings

❌ **NOT Household Profiles**:
- These are user-generated content
- Owned by the subscriber
- Like rows in a spreadsheet

### GDPR Implementation

```typescript
// Data Subject Rights - Only for Subscribers
class GDPRCompliance {
  // Right to Access
  async exportSubscriberData(subscriberId: string) {
    return {
      account: await getSubscriberAccount(subscriberId),
      billing: await getBillingHistory(subscriberId),
      settings: await getSettings(subscriberId),
      householdContent: await exportAllHouseholdData(subscriberId), // Their content
      activityLog: await getSubscriberActivityLog(subscriberId)
    };
  }

  // Right to Deletion
  async deleteSubscriber(subscriberId: string) {
    // Delete entire household and all content
    await deleteAllHouseholdContent(subscriberId);
    await deleteSubscriberAccount(subscriberId);
    // No need to handle individual "family member" requests
  }

  // Right to Rectification
  async updateSubscriberData(subscriberId: string, updates: any) {
    // Only subscriber account data can be updated
    // Household profiles are managed through the app
  }
}
```

### Privacy Policy Approach

**Clear Positioning**:
```
"Taschengeld is a household management tool for adults. 
Like a spreadsheet or notebook, you decide what to track 
and what the numbers mean. We don't collect information 
from children or verify the identity of household members 
you create in the app."
```

## COPPA Compliance Strategy

### Why COPPA Doesn't Apply

1. **Not Directed to Children**
   - Marketed to adults (parents, guardians, households)
   - Requires adult account creation
   - Payment method required

2. **No Direct Collection from Children**
   - Children don't create accounts
   - Children don't provide personal information
   - All data entry is by the subscriber

3. **The Excel Precedent**
   - Like Microsoft isn't liable for children's data in Excel
   - We provide the tool; adults control the usage
   - User-generated content model

### Safe Harbor Provisions

Even though COPPA doesn't apply, we maintain safety:

1. **Age Gate for Account Creation**
   ```
   ☐ I confirm I am 18 years or older
   ```

2. **Clear Terms of Service**
   ```
   "This service is for adults managing their households.
   You are responsible for any content you create and any
   access you provide to household members."
   ```

3. **No Direct Marketing to Children**
   - All marketing targets adults
   - Features focus on household management
   - No cartoon characters or child-focused design

## Data Minimization in Practice

### What We Collect

**From Subscribers (Adults)**:
- Email for account access
- Payment information for billing
- Usage data for service improvement
- Support tickets and communication

**NOT Collected**:
- Ages of household members
- Real names of household members
- Relationships between profiles
- Whether profiles represent real people

### Database Example

```sql
-- COLLECTED: Subscriber creates profiles
INSERT INTO household_profiles (subscriber_id, nickname, avatar_id) 
VALUES ('sub_123', 'Dragon', 'avatar_dragon');

-- NOT COLLECTED: No personal information
-- No age, no real name, no verification
-- "Dragon" could be 6-year-old Tim, 16-year-old Tim, or the family cat
```

## International Compliance

2. **Neutral Jurisdiction**

## Incident Response

### If Questioned About Children's Data

**Standard Response**:
```
"Taschengeld is a household management tool for adult subscribers. 
Like a spreadsheet or task list, subscribers create profiles to 
organize their household. We don't collect data from children or 
verify the age or identity of household members. The subscriber 
owns and controls all household data they create."
```

### If Regulatory Inquiry

1. **Emphasize Tool Nature**
   - Show it's general-purpose
   - Compare to Excel or Notion
   - Demonstrate adult-focused design

2. **Show Subscriber Control**
   - All data tied to adult account
   - Subscriber creates all content
   - No direct child interaction

3. **Provide Documentation**
   - This compliance strategy
   - Terms of service
   - Privacy policy
   - Marketing materials

## Conclusion

By positioning Taschengeld as a household management tool rather than a children's service, we:

1. **Simplify Compliance**: Focus only on adult subscriber data
2. **Reduce Risk**: Avoid complex children's privacy regulations
3. **Increase Flexibility**: Let households use the tool as they wish
4. **Maintain Honesty**: Don't pretend to know who uses profiles

This approach is legally sound, technically simpler, and more honest about what our service actually does. We provide the tool; households decide how to use it.
