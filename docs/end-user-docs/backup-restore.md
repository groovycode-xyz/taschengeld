# Full Backup and Restore

## What is Full Backup?

Full Backup is like taking a complete snapshot of all your data at a specific moment in time. It saves everything in your Taschengeld app:
- All user profiles (name, birthday, icon, sound, etc.)
- All tasks (active and inactive)
- All completed tasks and their history
- All piggy bank accounts and their balances
- All transaction history
- All app settings

## When to Use Full Backup

✅ **Use Full Backup when you want to:**
- Keep a safe copy of all your data
- Move your data to a new device or installation
- Create a safety net before making major changes
- Set up a new instance of the app with your existing data

## How to Create a Full Backup

1. Click on the Settings icon in the top right corner
2. Go to the "Backup and Restore" section
3. Under "Full Backup", click the "Download" button
4. The backup file will be saved to your device with a name like: `taschengeld-all-backup-[date].json`
5. Store this file in a safe place

## About Full Restore

Think of Full Restore as completely resetting your app and replacing everything with the data from your backup file. It's an "all-or-nothing" process.

⚠️ **Important to Know:**
- Full Restore will completely replace ALL existing data
- There is no way to keep some current data and restore only specific parts
- Any changes made after the backup was created will be lost
- You cannot restore to a specific point in time
- Once started, the restore process cannot be partially completed

## When to Use Full Restore

✅ **Use Full Restore when:**
- Setting up the app on a new device
- Recovering from data loss or corruption
- Want to return to a previous known good state
- Moving to a new installation

❌ **Do NOT use Full Restore when:**
- You only want to restore specific users or tasks
- You want to keep some recent changes
- You want to merge backup data with existing data
- You want to restore to a specific date or time

> **Note:** The application does not support those capabilities.

## How to Restore from a Full Backup

1. Click on the Settings icon in the top right corner
2. Go to the "Backup and Restore" section
3. Under "Full Backup", click the "Restore" button
4. Select your backup file when prompted
5. Wait for the restore process to complete

⚠️ **Before Restoring:**
- Make sure you have a backup of your current data if you might need it later
- Verify you have selected the correct backup file
- Understand that ALL current data will be replaced

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**
   - Create a new backup before making major changes
   - Keep regular backups (weekly or monthly)
   - Store backups in a safe place (not just on your device)

2. **Backup File Management**
   - Keep multiple backup files
   - Name them clearly with dates
   - Delete old backups you no longer need
   - Test your backups occasionally by viewing the file

3. **Safe Restore**
   - Always create a new backup before restoring
   - Double-check you're using the correct backup file
   - Inform all users before performing a restore
   - Verify the restore was successful afterward

## Limitations

To avoid confusion, here are things the Full Backup and Restore feature cannot do:

- Cannot restore individual users or tasks
- Cannot restore specific transactions or time periods
- Cannot merge backup data with existing data
- Cannot restore to a specific point in time
- Cannot selectively keep some current data while restoring other parts

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during backup or restore:
- Check that your backup file hasn't been modified or corrupted
- Ensure you have enough storage space


Remember: It's better to have a backup and not need it, than to need a backup and not have it!
