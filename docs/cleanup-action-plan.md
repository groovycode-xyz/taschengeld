# Codebase Cleanup Action Plan

## Purpose
This action plan is designed to systematically identify and address potential areas for cleanup and improvement in the codebase. The goal is to enhance maintainability, reduce redundancy, and ensure consistent patterns across the application while preserving all existing functionality.

## Key Reference Document
The [User Experience Flow](./user-experience-flow.md) document serves as our source of truth for:
- Component relationships and dependencies
- Required functionality and features
- Data flow and state management requirements
- Interface behavior specifications
- Component-specific requirements

Before marking any item as complete in this action plan, verify alignment with the UX Flow document.

## Approach
1. **Systematic Review**: Work through each category sequentially
2. **Documentation First**: Document findings before making any changes
3. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes rather than large refactors
4. **Verification**: Test thoroughly after each change
5. **Track Progress**: Update this document as we complete items
6. **UX Sync**: Cross-reference changes with UX Flow document

## Guardrails
1. **No Direct Deletions**
   - Never delete code without explicit approval
   - Mark potentially unused code with `.unused` suffix first
   - Wait for verification before permanent removal
   - Verify component is not specified in UX Flow document

2. **Preserve Functionality**
   - Maintain all existing business logic
   - Keep separate components that have justified differences
   - Don't combine components just for the sake of consolidation
   - Ensure changes align with UX Flow specifications

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Document test cases before making changes
   - Ensure all existing tests pass after changes
   - Add new tests for refactored code
   - Verify test coverage matches UX Flow requirements

4. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Update relevant documentation with each change
   - Document the reasoning behind significant changes
   - Keep the changelog up to date
   - Maintain synchronization with UX Flow document

5. **Review Process**
   - Present findings before implementing changes
   - Get explicit approval for each proposed change
   - Document any decisions made during review
   - Cross-reference changes with UX Flow document

## Notes
2024-03-20: Currency Display and User Card Component Analysis
- Currency Display Components Review:
  - `/components/ui/currency-display.tsx`: Active component
    - Used in: completed-task-card, piggy-bank, task-management, transaction-history-modal
    - Features: useCurrency hook, flexible formatting, locale support
    - Confirmed as the current production version
  - `/components/currency-display.tsx`: Legacy component
    - No active imports found
    - Less feature-rich implementation
    - Candidate for .unused designation
- User Card Components Review:
  - `/components/user-card.tsx`: Active component
    - Full implementation with specific styling
    - Used for user selection interfaces
  - `/components/ui/user-card.tsx`: Empty file (0 bytes)
    - No implementation or usage
    - Candidate for removal

Planned Actions (in order):
1. Remove empty user-card.tsx from UI directory
2. Mark unused currency display as .unused
3. Verify no regressions after each change

2024-03-20: CSS/Styling Files Analysis
- Global Styling Structure:
  - Primary global styles in `app/globals.css`
  - Tailwind CSS implementation (configured via `tailwind.config.ts`)
  - No duplicate global style files found
- Component Styling Analysis:
  - All components use Tailwind CSS classes consistently
  - UI components properly organized in `components/ui/`
  - shadcn/ui components follow consistent patterns
  - No standalone CSS file duplicates found
- Previously Identified and Addressed:
  - Currency display components: One marked as unused
  - User card components: Empty duplicate removed
  - Sound selection modals: Consolidated and marked unused
- Currently Marked as Unused:
  - `mode-toggle.tsx.unused`
  - `Layout.tsx.unused`
  - `icon-selector.tsx.unused`
  - `select-sound-modal.tsx.unused`
  - `select-user-sound-modal.tsx.unused`

Findings Summary:
1. No duplicate standalone CSS files exist
2. Component styles are well-organized and maintained
3. Previously identified duplicates properly marked
4. Clear separation between global and component-specific styles
5. Consistent use of Tailwind CSS throughout the application

2024-03-20: Style Import Analysis
- Global Style Import:
  - Single import of `globals.css` in `app/layout.tsx`
  - Correctly placed at root layout level
  - No redundant imports found
- Tailwind Integration:
  - Clean utility setup in `lib/utils.ts`
    - Uses `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for class management
    - Single utility function `cn()` for class name handling
  - Proper configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`
    - Single import of required plugins
    - No duplicate configurations
- Style Import Findings:
  - No component-level CSS imports found
  - No redundant style sheet imports
  - No duplicate Tailwind configurations
  - Consistent use of utility functions for class management

Findings Summary:
1. Single, correctly placed global CSS import
2. Clean Tailwind utility implementation

4. Consistent class name management approach
5. Well-organized style configuration

2024-03-20: Unused/Orphaned Style Files Analysis

    - Theme variables and configurations
    - Global theme transitions
    - All contents actively used
