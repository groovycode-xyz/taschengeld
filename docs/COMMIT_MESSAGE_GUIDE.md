## Tips for Better Release Notes

1. **Start with action verbs:** Add, Fix, Update, Improve, Implement
2. **Be user-focused:** What does this change do for users?
3. **Include context:** Which part of the app is affected?
4. **Avoid internal jargon:** Users don't care about "refactoring"
5. **Use conventional commits:** feat:, fix:, ui:, docs:, etc.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Working on savings goal deletion feature
git commit -m "feat(savings): Add delete goal button to edit modal"
git commit -m "feat(savings): Implement balance transfer confirmation dialog"  
git commit -m "feat(api): Add DELETE endpoint with transfer_balance parameter"
git commit -m "ui: Enhance goal card with delete confirmation workflow"

# When you release, these become:
# ‚ú® New Features

```

## Testing Your Messages

Before pushing, test how your commits will look:
