# Archive Directory - 2025-01-21 Cleanup

This directory contains artifacts archived during the January 21, 2025 cleanup investigation.

## Purpose

These files/directories were identified as potentially unnecessary but archived rather than deleted to allow for safe rollback if needed.

## Structure

- `phase1-empty-dirs/` - Empty or unused directories
- `phase2-temp-files/` - Temporary and generated files
- `phase3-dev-artifacts/` - Development tools and artifacts
- `phase4-db-artifacts/` - Database-related legacy files
- `phase5-docs/` - Obsolete documentation
- `phase6-build-configs/` - Build and configuration artifacts

## Rollback Instructions

If any functionality breaks after archiving:

1. Identify which phase contains the needed files
2. Move the files back to their original location
3. Update ARTIFACT_CLEANUP_PLAN.md with the rollback details

## Retention

This archive can be safely deleted after the application has been running successfully for 30 days post-cleanup.
